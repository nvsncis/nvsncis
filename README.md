# Security Researcher
I break Android apps, web APIs, and networks by exploiting real-world misconfigurations. My work focuses on hands-on exploitation, combining reverse engineering with dynamic analysis to uncover practically exploitable vulnerabilities.

## Focus Areas
* **Android Security:** Reverse engineering APKs (Smali/Java) and native .so libraries; Bypassing SSL Pinning, Root detection, and Integrity/anti-tampering checks; Identifying insecure data storage and sensitive data exposure.
* **Web & API Security:** SQL Injection (Union, Blind, Time-based), Cross-Site Scripting (Stored, Reflected, DOM), IDOR/BOLA, and business logic flaws.
* **Network & Wireless:** MITM attacks in misconfigured networks, Evil Twin attacks, Handshake capture/deauthentication, and traffic/protocol analysis.

## Tooling
* **Mobile & RE:** Frida, JADX, ApkTool, Ghidra
* **Web & Network:** Burp Suite, Mitmproxy, SQLMap, Nmap
* **Wireless:** Aircrack-ng, Wireshark
* **Environment:** Kali Linux, Bash, Python
